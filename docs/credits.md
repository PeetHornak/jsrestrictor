# Developpers

[Libor Polčák](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~polcak) was behind an idea to implement a webextension that works as a firewall for JavaScript APIs. He is the current main maintainer. He supervised/supervises diploma theses that improves the web extension.

Zbyněk Červinka developped a [proof-of-concept version](https://github.com/cervinka-zbynek/masters-thesis) of this extension as a part of his [master's thesis](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/thesis/21274/) (in Czech).

Martin Timko developped first public versions upto [0.2.1](https://github.com/polcak/jsrestrictor/releases/tag/0.2.1) as a part of his [master's thesis](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/thesis/21824/). He also  ported the extension to Chrome and Opera.

# Key ideas

The development of this extension is influenced by the paper [JavaScript Zero: Real JavaScript and Zero Side-Channel Attacks](https://misc0110.net/web/files/jszero.pdf). It appeared during the work of Zbyněk Červinka and provided basically the same approach to restrict APIs as was at the time developped by Zbyněk Červinka.
